# Real vs Fake Face Classification

![Alt text](demo.png)

## Overview

Real vs Fake Face Classification is a powerful tool that leverages deep learning to distinguish between real human faces and AI-generated (fake) ones. In today's world, where AI-generated images are becoming increasingly sophisticated, this tool helps ensure the authenticity of visual content. For instance, if someone were to create a fake image by inserting your face into a compromising situation or photoshopping it onto someone else's body, this tool will accurately classify the image as fake, thus protecting your reputation.

Simply upload the image, and the machine learning model will evaluate it and provide a response within seconds. This tool is designed to be user-friendly, with a clean and intuitive interface, making it accessible to everyone.
